Your idols from the posters end up jumping off the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
Your idols from the posters end up jumping off the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
Your idols from the posters end up jumping off the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
Your idols from the posters end up jumping off the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering

While you're breathing, while the hashish is smoldering
Do you hear the drops falling from the roofs
A frenzy without falsehood and lies, I decided so, I was in a hurry, I sinned
And I took it for grashi, and you're all so good
You're like galoshes, you all look alike
And definitely everyone here owes you something.
But it's already difficult, the alarm was false
In an abandoned basement, do not move carefully
Sometimes it is simply impossible not to carefully collect the frames
The truth is laid in coffins while hashish is smoldering
Your wife is naked, the situation is tense here
While the hashish is smoldering, I'm fucking with the bong
Smoke up to the ceiling... It's going to be a long time

The sound of drums will get right under your skin
There is a Balabanov for every Tarantino
You're going to shake like an ass from Brazilian carnivals.
And I'll open your head, eat all the cockroaches.
And while hashish is smoldering, I'm not making grandiose plans
How many dead fish are hidden in the pelicans' bag
Right in your face? Or into magazine paper
And from what kind of annals did so many channels come out
It's a jungle of neighborhoods, I'm wearing Papuan beads
He knows how we can turn you into an animal from scratch
An unspoken phrase settled in every throat
It's no secret what's playing on the faggot's playlist there
And the glued vase fell to the floor again
It seems to have understood absolutely everything, but the fuck since when
Any medicine still hides an infection
But we only look straight, we look brazenly in both eyes

To remain mute between the concrete blocks in the abyss of silence
I hid the desire, to convey my meaning
Rather than bursting into speeches, it's better to break into a smile
And rather than carry a load on my shoulders, I'd rather taste the smoke.
These are the remnants of the human that you love to taste so much
Digging into someone else's underwear, what are you wearing yourself
Everyone feeds on what they got in the thorny roads
But those who don't taste picky, that's what he carries
This is the knowledge of light through pitch darkness
You didn't understand, your thoughts didn't come up and you're being dragged along the bottom
While hashish is smouldering here, there is still time to think
What is freedom for you and where is your ceiling in it
The stupid herd is fed with hay, a pale shade on their faces
Chains around their necks, sum up your own
And there's no point in talking, everyone eats their own shit
And then your feelings are for everyone here like a fucking stain on a T-shirt

Your idols are from the posters, as a result, I jump from the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
Your idols are from the posters, as a result, I jump from the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
Your idols are from the posters, as a result, I jump from the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
Your idols are from the posters, as a result, I jump from the roofs
While the mouse is sniffing the cheese, while the hashish is smouldering
